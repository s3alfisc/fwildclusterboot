Description: Implementation of fast algorithms for wild cluster bootstrap 
             inference developed in 'Roodman et al' (2019, 'STATA' Journal,
             <doi:10.1177/1536867X19830877>) and 'MacKinnon et al' (2022), 
             which makes it feasible to quickly calculate bootstrap test 
             statistics based on a large number of bootstrap draws even for 
             large samples. Multiple bootstrap types as described in 'MacKinnon, 
             Nielsen & Webb' (2022) are supported. 
             Further, 'multiway' clustering, regression weights, 
             bootstrap weights, fixed effects and 'subcluster' bootstrapping
             are supported. Further, both restricted ('WCR') and unrestricted
             ('WCU') bootstrap are supported. Methods are provided for a variety 
             of fitted models, including 'lm()', 'feols()' 
             (from package 'fixest') and 'felm()' (from package 'lfe'). 
             Additionally implements a 'heteroskedasticity-robust' ('HC1') wild 
             bootstrap.
             Further, the package provides an R binding to 'WildBootTests.jl',
             which provides additional speed gains and functionality, 
             including the 'WRE' bootstrap for instrumental variable models 
             (based on models of type 'ivreg()' from package 'ivreg')
             and hypotheses with q > 1.
