Description: Implementation of fast algorithms for wild cluster bootstrap
    inference developed in 'Roodman et al' (2019, 'STATA' Journal,
    <doi:10.1177/1536867X19830877>) and 'MacKinnon et al' (2022), which
    makes it feasible to quickly calculate bootstrap test statistics based
    on a large number of bootstrap draws even for large samples.  Multiple
    bootstrap types as described in 'MacKinnon, Nielsen & Webb' (2022) are
    supported.  Further, 'multiway' clustering, regression weights,
    bootstrap weights, fixed effects and 'subcluster' bootstrapping are
    supported. Further, both restricted ('WCR') and unrestricted ('WCU')
    bootstrap are supported. Methods are provided for a variety of fitted
    models, including 'lm()', 'feols()' (from package 'fixest') and
    'felm()' (from package 'lfe').  Additionally implements a
    'heteroskedasticity-robust' ('HC1') wild bootstrap.  Last, the package
    provides an R binding to 'WildBootTests.jl', which provides additional
    speed gains and functionality, including the 'WRE' bootstrap for
    instrumental variable models (based on models of type 'ivreg()' from
    package 'ivreg') and hypotheses with q > 1.
