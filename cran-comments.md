## Resubmission of 0.12.1 

Change JuliaConnectoR link in readme to "https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=JuliaConnectoR".

## Resubmission of 0.12.1

I have added additional information on how to download WildBootTests.jl to the description file. 

I have also corrected the link to the JuliaConnectoR package, which now points to CRAN instead of the github repo.

Tests via rhub and github actions pass without notes. 


## Resubmission of 0.12.1

I have added comments regarding the SystemRequirements for Julia and WildBootTests.jl, including a link where to download 
Julia from. I also mention that WildBootTests.jl can be downloaded from the Julia package manager. 

Note that the package runs completely fine without either Julia or WildBootTests.jl - 
the API to the Julia package is completely optional. 

In consequence, I could also completely drop the SystemRequirements section from the description file and simply mention the minimal package versions in the vignette.

I have checked the package on rhub and github actions, without any additional notes / warnings. 

## fwildclusterboot 0.12.1

This is a hot-fix release which turns of some tests that fail on  ATLAS MKL OpenBLAS . 

No tests fail on github actions, rhub and win-devel.

Only one note found: 

"‚ùØ checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
  Found the following files/directories:
    'lastMiKTeXException'".
